<title>Nomic Kittens Rules</title>

<body content="text/text; charset=UTF-8">

<h1>Current Ruleset</h1>
<p>While I believe it to be accurate as of its most recent upload, if I go on vacation, die, start making things up, or even make a mistake, this document might come to vary widely from the ruleset as it actually exists.  However, for the rules proposed and voted in chat, this document is the only extant record of which I am aware; if anybody saved chat logs, let me know and I will add them to the website. The initial rules can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l9MxBOHv9qI5nVqZCIlsVpWIjiK6pIluDMZn6saYWR0/edit">here</a>.</p>

<p>1. A rule change is any of the following:<br>
&emsp;(1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a rule; or<br>
&emsp;(2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a rule.</p>
*
<p>2. All rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.</p>
*
<p>3. Every player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on rule changes.</p>
*
<p>4. All proposed rule changes shall be written down before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were voted on.</p>
*
<p>5. No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule change may have retroactive application.</p>
*
<p>6. Each proposed rule change shall be given a number for reference. The numbers shall begin with one more than the current highest rule, and each rule change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.<br>
If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of the proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended, it receives the number of the proposal to amend it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, the entire rule of which it is a part receives the number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.</p>
*
<p>7. If a rule change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more rule changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to end debate and vote.</p>
*
<p>8. A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed.</p>
*
<p>9. The adoption of rule changes must never become completely impermissible.</p>
*
<p>10. Rule changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule changes are as permissible as other rule changes. Even rule changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.</p>
*
<p>11. Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.</p>
*
<p>12. Players shall alternate turns in alphabetical order by username, taking one whole turn apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points.</p>
*
<p>13. One turn consists of three parts in this order:<br>
&emsp;(1) proposing one rule change and having it voted on,<br>
&emsp;(2) throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score, and,<br>
&emsp;(3) one or more turn(s) of exploding kittens.<br>
In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players subtract 85 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer.</p>
*
<p>
14.<br>
<s>A rule change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. If this rule is not amended by the end of the second complete circuit of turns, it automatically changes to require only a simple majority.</s><br>
Repealed by &#60;Rule 89&#62;.
</p>
*
<p>15. If and when rule changes can be adopted without unanimity, the players who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10 points each.</p>
*
<p>16. An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.</p>
*
<p>17. When a proposed rule change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.</p>
*
<p>18. Each player always has exactly one vote.</p>
*
<p>19. The winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points.</p>
*
<p>20. Players may not conspire or consult on the making of future rule changes unless they are team-mates. This rule does not apply to games by mail or computer.</p>
*
<p>21. If two or more rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.<br>
If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.<br>
If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.</p>
*
<p>22. If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called invoking Judgment.<br>
When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or her turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.<br>
The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.<br>
Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.<br>
New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.</p>
*
<p>23. If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player unable to complete a turn is the winner.<br>
This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.</p>
*
<p>24. This rule is intentionally left blank.</p>
*
<p>25. This rule is intentionally left blank.</p>
*
<p>26. The deck is an agreed upon pile of cards, with the cards below modified in accordance with the number of players and the decks being played.<br>
For reference, here is a listing of all cards at the time of writing, and where they are found:<br>

*
<p>27. Everybody starts the game with 1 defuse and 7 other cards, for a total of 8. A hand will not start with an exploding kitten.</p>
*
<p>28. A single turn in Exploding Kittens starts by playing zero or more cards, carrying out the effects labeled on each card by the rules listed below, and discarding that card after use. A turn is ended by drawing a card unless stated otherwise.</p>
*
<p>29. At no point may a player display their cards for other players to see, but verbally saying what they have or asking other is acceptable.</p>
*
<p>30. Exploding Kitten<br>
You must show this card immediately. Unless you have a Defuse Card, you’re dead. Discard all of your cards, including the Exploding Kitten.</p>
*
<p>31. Defuse<br>
If you drew an Exploding Kitten, you can play this card instead of dying. Place your Defuse Card in the Discard Pile. Then take the Exploding Kitten, and without reordering or viewing the other cards, secretly put it back in the Draw Pile anywhere you’d like. Your turn is over after playing this card.</p>
*
<p>32. Nope<br>
Stop any action except for an Exploding Kitten or a Defuse Card, including other Nope cards. This can be played at any time.</p>
*
<p>33. Attack x2<br>
Immediately end your turn(s) without drawing a card and force the next player to take 2 turns in a row. The victim of this card takes a turn as normal, then, when their first turn is over, it’s their turn again. If the victim of an attack draws an Exploding Kitten and defuses it, they must still take any remaining turns. If the victim of an Attack Card plays an Attack Card, their turns are immediately over, and the next player must take any remaining turns plus 2 more.</p>
*
<p>34. Skip<br>
Immediately end your turn without drawing a card. If you play a Skip Card as a defense to an Attack Card, it only ends 1 of the 2 turns. 2 Skip Cards would end both turns.</p>
*
<p>35. Favor<br>
Force any other player to give you 1 card from their hand. They choose which card to give you.</p>
*
<p>36. Shuffle<br>
Shuffle the Draw Pile without viewing the cards until told to stop.</p>
*
<p>37. See the Future x1<br>
Privately view the top card from the Draw Pile, and put it back in the same order.</p>
*
<p>38. See the Future x3<br>
Privately view the top 3 cards from the Draw Pile, and put them back in the same order.</p>
*
<p>39. See the Future x5<br>
Privately view the top 5 cards from the Draw Pile, and put them back in the same order.</p>
*
<p>40. Alter the Future x3<br>
Privately view the top 3 cards from the Draw Pile, and rearrange them in any order you’d like.</p>
*
<p>41. Alter the Future x5<br>
Privately view the top 5 cards from the Draw Pile, and rearrange them in any order you'd like.</p>
*
<p>42. Double Slap<br>
End your turn without drawing a card and force any other player to take 2 turns in a row.</p>
*
<p>43. Triple Slap<br>
End your turn without drawing a card and force any other player to take 3 turns in a row. </p>
*
<p>44. Draw from the Bottom<br>
End your turn by drawing the bottom card from the Draw Pile.</p>
*
<p>45. Reverse<br>
Reverse the order of play and end your turn without drawing.</p>
*
<p>46. Imploding Kitten<br>
When this card is drawn, put it back into the Draw Pile FACE UP anywhere you’d like in secret. Do not use a Defuse Card. When you have no choice but to draw this card face up, you immediately implode and are out of the game. This card cannot be defused, nor can it be noped. When the Imploding Kitten implodes and kills a player, it must be put into the Discard Pile just like an Exploding Kitten would be. If there is an Imploding Kitten face up on top of the deck and you play a Shuffle Card, shuffle the deck under the table so that you still have a chance of shuffling the Imploding Kitten back to the top of the deck without realizing it. If you're playing with the Streaking Kittens expansion deck, the Imploding Kitten does not affect the Streaking Kitten.</p>
*
<p>47. Targeted Attack<br>
Immediately end your turn(s) without drawing a card and choose any player to take 2 turns in a row. Play then continues from the attacked player.</p>
*
<p>48. Streaking Kitten<br>
While this card is in your hand, you can also secretly hold 1 Exploding Kitten without exploding.<br>
&emsp;(1) If the Streaking Kitten leaves your hand for any reason, the Exploding Kitten in your hand will explode.<br>
&emsp;(2) If another player steals or receives an Exploding Kitten from your hand, they explode. They must defuse it or lose the game. <br>
&emsp;(3) If you take any action causing you to play an Exploding Kitten from your hand into the Discard Pile, you explode. You must defuse it or lose the game.<br>
&emsp;(4) Streaking Kittens and Exploding Kittens can not be used with the 5 Card Special Combo. This means you can't use either of them in your collection of 5 cards, nor can you remove either of them from the Discard Pile. <br>
&emsp;(5) If you’re playing with the Imploding Kittens expansion deck, the Streaking Kitten does not affect the Imploding Kitten.</p>
*
<p>49. Super Skip<br>
End your turn(s) without drawing a card.</p>
*
<p>50. Swap Top and Bottom<br>
Swap the top and bottom cards of the Draw Pile without looking.</p>
*
<p>51. Garbage Collection<br>
Every player who has cards (including the player who played this card) must choose 1 card from their hand to secretly insert into the Draw Pile. Then, shuffle the entire Draw Pile.</p>
*
<p>52. Catomic Bomb<br>
Remove all the Exploding Kittens from the Draw Pile so that everyone can see them. Then, shuffle the Draw Pile, and return the Exploding Kittens face down on top. End your turn without drawing a card. If you are playing with the Imploding Kittens expansion deck, do not remove the Imploding Kitten when you remove the Exploding Kittens.</p>
*
<p>53. Mark<br>
Pick a target player. Randomly pick 1 of their cards and 'mark' it by returning the card to their hand facing out to the other players. The card is still part of their hand (and they can look at it), but it must stay marked until it is played or stolen. If a marked card is stolen, it doesn’t stay marked.</p>
*
<p>54. Feral Cat<br>
Use as any Cat Card (card with no effect). This card cannot be used as a non-Cat Card (Shuffle, Double Slap, etc).</p>
*
<p>55. Curse of the Cat Butt<br>
Pick a target player. That player must immediately make their cards BLIND by putting them face down on the table and shuffling them. The blind player is not allowed to look at any of their cards until they successfully draw a card from the Draw Pile without exploding. On their turn, if the blind player decides to play any cards, those cards must be picked randomly and played face up on the Discard Pile. If the card is playable, play as normal.<br>
&emsp;(1) BLIND Exploding Kitten: If you draw an Exploding Kitten (and don’t have a Streaking Kitten), that does not count as successfully drawing a card. You must now play cards blindly until you play a Defuse. All non-Defuse Cards played are lost without any effect. After successfully defusing the Exploding Kitten, you can return to non-blind play. If you play an Exploding Kitten while blind, you explode immediately and must blindly defuse the Exploding Kitten or lose the game. If you’re the most unlucky person in the world and play an Exploding Kitten while trying to defuse an Exploding Kitten, you must defuse each of them before continuing.<br>
&emsp;(2) BLIND Favor: If you play a Favor Card while blind, you may look at the card you receive before turning it face down and shuffling it into your hand on the table.<br>
&emsp;(3) BLIND Mark: If an opponent marks you while you are blind (or if you become blind while holding a marked card), the marked card must remain facing the opposite direction from the rest of your hand until it is played or stolen.<br>
&emsp;(4) BLIND Three of a Kind: If an opponent plays the “Three of a Kind” special combo on you while you are blind, find the card requested (if you have it), give it to them, then put your cards back on the table blind and shuffle them.<br>
&emsp;(5) BLIND Garbage Collection: If Garbage Collection is played while you are blind, you must pick a card to contribute without looking at your cards. After you have made your selection, you may secretly view the card (so that if you’ve accidentally given up a Streaking Kitten and you’re left with an Exploding Kitten in your hand, you can try to defuse it).</p>
*
<p>56. Amateur Archaeology<br>
Choose any card from the discard pile and randomly put it into the draw pile.</p>
*
<p>
57. Hip Cat<br>
<s>Pick a player and play "Rock, Paper, Scissors". If you tie, Each takes a card from the discard pile. If not, the winner takes 2 cards from the discard pile.</s>

*
<p>62. The Twins<br>

Place this card in front of an opponent. For the next three rounds, that opponent must discard a card at the start of their turn.</p>

Choose a player. That player must say the words "I love you" while giving you their diffuse card.</p>
*
<p>65. Kitten President<br>
Go through the draw pile and relocate all of the exploding kittens to anywhere in the deck.</p>
*
<p>66. Battle Hamster<br>
Choose a player. That player discards down to one card.</p>
*
<p>67. Caternator<br>
This 'Exploding Kitten' goes into your hand without exploding. It only detonates when someone pulls it from your hand. They are exploded while you remain unharmed.</p>
*
<p>68. Cat to the Future<br>
Take the card that the previous player drew (from their hand or from the deck), and repeat the play.</p>
*
<p>69. The Mad Catter<br>
Take a shot of a drink, then put the card back in the draw pile and reshuffle it.</p>

<p>84. Special Combo: Three of a kind (special combo): Playing matching Three of the same Cat Card allows one to ask a player for a card, and it must be given.</p>

86.<br>
Proposed by: Imanton1<br>
Status: Active (3/3 Yea)<br>
A player must finish their turn within 24 hours of the turn starting. When somebody has noticed, if the turn has not been finished by this time, the player will lose 10% (absolute floor)<sup>1</sup> of their points and their turn will end. If the turn was still waiting on a vote, instead, the unvoted players will all lose 10% (absolute floor) of the total of their points<sup>2</sup>, their vote will be considered null and void for the tally, and the turn will continue, with 12 more hours on the turn timer.<br>

Gaining or losing is part of this gem, stagnancy is not what we want is such kind of game.<br>
Now, when another player starts his round, he has to play one of his cards. Switching for a rule 87 now players had to throw a card or lose points seven. (You have to play at least one card during your turn or lose 7 points, remove rule 87 because of rule 95)
