<h1>&#x1F389 You are invited to play Nomic Kittens &#x1F389</h1>
<p><a href="https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm">Nomic</a> is an game where each move in the game changes the rules of the game, even how you win can be modified. This version of Nomic uses <a href="https://explodingkittens.com/how-to-play/">Exploding Kittens</a> as a base, so players will be playing with cards in addition to making new rules. You want a rule that lets you take cards from other players if they fail a dice roll? Just change the rules. You want to be called president and collect tax from other people? Just make a new rule.</p>
<p>This game is played in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess">correspondence</a> fashion, so you only need to check in every few hours.</p>
<h3>Get Started</h3>

	<li>Create a <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord account</a> if you haven't already.</li>
	<li>Ask the person who sent you this invitation for entry to the <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/545368307046416424/545368307570573324">general channel</a> and introduce yourself! The server admin (me!) will add you to the verified human players list.</li>
	<li>After you have been verified, enter the <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/545368307046416424/595427470430437412">nomic-kittens channel</a> and type <code>!enter</code> to enter as a player and then <code>!help</code> to see a list of all commands.</li>

More information on the game:
The game will take place in 
Each turn will have four parts:

<ol>
	<li>You declare a rule to be added, changed or removed.</li>
	<li>A vote will be taken, if a majority agrees, it goes through.</li>
	<li>Points will be given accordingly.</li>
	<li>
		You play zero or more cards from your hand using <code>!play [card]</code>.
		<ul><li>The play command only checks if you have a card and moves it to the discard, to allow time for a <abbr title="">NOPE</abbr> to go through, an admin will run the effects of the card(s).</li></ul>
	</li>
<li>Draw a card from the deck using <code>!draw</code> and end your turn using <code>!end</code>.</li>
</ol>

So here is an exmaple turn:
<ol>
	<li>"I propose a new rule. At the end of a round, each player who did not play a card must give every player who did play a card 1 point."</li>
	<li>Vote: 5 Yea. The rule goes through sucessfully.</li>
	<li>Points will be given accordingly, as the first new rule is rule 86, and 4 of the 5 players voted yes, the proposer would recieve 1 point.</li>
	<li>I play See the future 3x. (wait to see if anyone nopes it.)</li>
	<li><code>!draw</code></li>
	<li><code>!end</code></li>
</ol>
