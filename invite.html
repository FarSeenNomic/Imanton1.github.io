<p>Nomic is an game where each move in the game changes the rules of the game, even how you win can be modified. This version of Nomic uses Exploding Kittens as a base, so players will be playing with cards in addition to making new rules. You want that lets you take cards from other players if they fail a dice roll? Just change the rules. You want to be called president and collect tax from other people? Just make a new rule.</p>
<p>This game is played in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess">correspondence</a> fashion, so you only need to check in every few hours.</p>
